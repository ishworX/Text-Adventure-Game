In the spectrum of the multiverse, there is a universe that is threatened by a great evil.
This evil is embodied in an entity called Thunas, a once enlightened being that went insane after
trying to explore the depths of evil. His original goal was to vanquish evil tendencies in
lifeforms, so they can live a pure life. However, he quickly realized that no matter what he did,
these lifeforms that inhabit planets throughout the universe will always act the same. Selfish,
jealousy, the want to kill, steal, etc. Completely being oblivious to the good around the evil,
Thunas came to a realization that he must destroy all lifeforms in his universe for the greater
good. Thunas has casted the 4 sacred artifacts across the universe, if a single person can capture
them all, the evil being can be stopped. If not, the galaxy will be destroyed by Thunas, for there
is no power greater than his besides these sacred artifacts. With no time for hesitation, you must
embark on this perilous journey alone and muster the confidence to face death head on! Collect
the 4 scared artifacts, “Shield of Absorption”, “Hammer of Lightening”, “Scrolls of Faith”,
and the greatest of them all “The Suit of the Legendary IRON WARROR!!!”. With these
4 ancient artifacts, you will be able to stand toe-to-toe with Thunas and anguish this genocidal manic.
